🤖 Machine Learning Automation App

One-click ML magic — from raw data to model accuracy leaderboard!

🚀 About the Project
Tired of cleaning data manually and applying ML models one by one?
This app does it all for you, so you can sip your coffee while the machine does the learning.

What it does:

📊 Explores your data (shape, columns, summary stats, unique values)

🧹 Cleans your data (removes nulls, drops messy columns, fills gaps)

🎨 Visualizes the data

⚙️ Applies ML algorithms automatically

🧠 Finds the best model based on accuracy

🏆 Suggests the top-performing model

All with just a few clicks. No coding. No fuss. Just results.
